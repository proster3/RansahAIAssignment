## About me

Hi! My name is Harsh. I’m currently pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in Technology with a specialization in Computer Science and Engineering at Graphic Era University.

I have a strong passion for web development, which has led me to build and deploy several full-stack applications using TypeScript, Node.js, and React. In addition to a few personal projects, I recently had the chance to intern with Codedamn, where I contributed to impactful features on their e-learning platform. I’m always exploring new technologies—my latest project, for instance, involves scaling a platform using edge runtime.
